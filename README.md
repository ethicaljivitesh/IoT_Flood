# IoT_Flood
**IoT DDoS Vulnerability Assessment Tool
**Description: This Open Source IoTProject to assess the vulnerability of IoT devices to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and evaluate their resistance to common attack vectors.
Key Features:
Test IoT devices' resistance to SYN flood, UDP flood, and HTTP-based DDoS attacks.
Evaluate devices' bandwidth consumption and CPU usage under attack.
Test mitigation techniques like rate limiting, filtering, or blocking traffic.
Comprehensive reporting on DDoS vulnerabilities.
